**uelbox** is a toolbox for working with Java Unified Expression Language (UEL).

The primary offering is a set of wrappers for decorating instances of the
various classes that comprise the Java Unified EL specification. These can be
used to piggyback onto a UEL implementation's processing of a given
expression. The basic concepts of this codebase were inspired by parts of
Apache Myfaces's Extensions Validator component.
